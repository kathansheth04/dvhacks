# PetCare

## About

Many pets are not given a proper diet because it is hard to measure the right amount of nutrition that is consumed by the pets everyday. Most pet owners decide to not have regular checkups or not have veterinary visits at all, regardless of how important they are. These compromises result in health conditions of the animals involving digestive upset which in turn results in issues such as severe obesity, diabetes, pancreatitis, and more. PetCare strives to alleviate this issue by providing a cross platform mobile application to pet owners that can help them maintain their pet's health accurately and efficiently. With modern technologies, our app achieves this through two methods: first is recognizing if a pet food item is healthy given the pet's current health and second is monitoring the pet's health with parameters such as calories consumed, amount of fat and sugar consumed, and much more. With this service, it is expected that a large number of pet owners will take advantage of the modern technology that this application utilizes in order to keep their pets healthy without regularly being dependent on professionals for guidance. Even though experts' guidance can be effective, this app provides an alternative to constantly track the pet's health and guide the users to make healthy choices for their pet, removing the necessity of frequent visits to professionals.
